Calling nonlinear and MINLP solvers from Julia:
interfaces, formats, expression trees and AD tools

While canonical interfaces for LP's are largely standardized across different
solvers and programming languages, this is not the case for nonlinear or
mixed-integer nonlinear optimization. Two existing tools in this area are the
AMPL Solver Library and the COIN-OR Optimization Services project. We will
discuss technical challenges and performance tradeoffs in using these tools
from the Julia language, which is uniquely able to be simultaneously
high-level, high-performance, user-friendly, and provide efficient interfaces
to widely used optimization libraries. The JuliaOpt organization and the
MathProgBase set of protocols present new levels of interoperability between
solvers and different styles of optimization modeling environments.
